# Automatic Railway Single-Line Diagram Generator Algorithm - Based on RDS Models

This is the repository for the Automated Single-Line Diagram Generation Algorithm developed in correspondence with a bachelor thesis at NTNU in collabaration with BaneNOR.
The algorithm generates single-line diagrams effectively if the railway system is modeled in accordance with the RDS standard and as described in the thesis.

## Developers
The algorithm development was spearheaded Haakon Hellebust, with Nima Salihzada and Sondre Klevan as co-developers.
